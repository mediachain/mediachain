# How to contribute

Welcome to the main mediachain repo. This is where most work on [Mediachain](https://medium.com/mine-labs/introducing-mediachain-a696f8fd2035) takes place. Please come find us in [#tech](https://mediachain.slack.com/messages/tech/) on the [mediachain slack](https://mediachain-slack.herokuapp.com/)

Here are some important resources:

  * The [roadmap](https://medium.com/mine-labs/mediachain-developer-update-v-a7f6006ad953) is the high level overview
  * [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/mediachain/mediachain/issues) is our day-to-day project management space
  * The [dev blog](https://medium.com/tag/mediachain) publishes weekly-ish updates from the core team

## Participating
Because Mediachain is a very new idea, a lot of architectural decisions still need to be made. This happens in the [Issues](https://github.com/mediachain/mediachain/issues).

## Submitting code

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](mediachain/mediachain/pulls) with a clear description of the patch, referencing any relevant issues.

## Coding conventions
_TBD_



Thanks, Arkadiy & the Mediachain team
